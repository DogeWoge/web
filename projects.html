<section role="main" class="col-xs-12">
  <p>This is a listing of some of my software projects. Things which are not on my list: my (nonexistent) hardware projects, my music projects, my (nonexistent) embroidery, my contact lenses, my (nonexistent) sense of self-worth.</p>

  <h3>Tsukiyo</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/tsukiyo/releases">https://github.com/eyqs/tsukiyo/releases</a></p>
  <a href="{{ "/assets/images/projects/tsukiyo.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/projects/tsukiyo.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screenshot of Tsukiyo displaying a truncated icosidodecahedron" height="264" width="240" /></a>
  <p>Tsukiyo is a program that displays and rotates various polytopes in 4D. I spent about four months developing it as the focus of my International Baccalaureate Extended Essay and Math Internal Assessment, and then two more years on and off until I released v1.0.0 in February 2016. You can enter in a Schl√§fli symbol or Wythoff symbol, set the viewing axes and rotation axes, and rotate your polytope to your heart's content. Although it seems simple, this is my proudest project, since I personally developed all its (very simple) algorithms from scratch, without any external references!</p>

  <h3>cvx</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/cvx/releases/">https://github.com/eyqs/grd/releases/</a></p>
  <a href="{{ "/assets/images/projects/cvx.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/projects/cvx.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screenshot of a webpage made by cvx compared to the original LaTeX" height="135" width="240" /></a>
  <p>cvx is a simple LaTeX to HTML translater written in Haskell. I made it for the sole purpose of converting my resume, cv.tex, into an HTML file I could put on this website. Turns out cvx's translating capabilities aren't limited to just resumes, but cvx's translating capabilities are limited in every other way. Maybe I'll improve it after taking a course on compilers or computational linguistics.</p>

  <h3>grd</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/grd/releases">https://github.com/eyqs/grd/releases</a></p>
  <a href="{{ "/assets/images/projects/grd.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/projects/grd.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screenshot of grd automatically writing input to a C script" height="135" width="465" /></a>
  <p>grd is a simple tool to help me grade C programming labs. I was a marking TA for UBC's APSC 160 in 2015WT2 and got frustrated at having to manually compile every single lab and manually quit to move through them all, so I made grd to automatically compile every single lab and automatically move through them all. Ultimately, I spent more time making grd than I saved, and I won't use it ever again, so...</p>

  <h3>kbr</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/kbr/releases">https://github.com/eyqs/kbr/releases</a></p>
  <a href="{{ "/assets/images/projects/kbr.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/projects/kbr.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screenshot of me typing 'KBR IS THE BEST' in kbr" height="164" width="234" /></a>
  <p>kbr is a simple typing tutor that teaches touch typing. I often want to use my laptop with one hand while eating an apple/sandwich/snail/ice cream cone with the other hand, but my hand gets tired after jumping across the whole keyboard for an hour (I eat very slowly). The way I taught myself the Dvorak layout was by generating all the words that only contained the letters I knew how to type, retyping them, and gradually adding in new keys. I thought I might as well turn it into an actual program, and here it is. I typed this entire page with one hand using the dvorak-l layout.</p>

  <h3>Tax Avoider</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/tax/">https://github.com/eyqs/tax/</a></p>
  <a href="{{ "/assets/images/projects/tax.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/projects/tax.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="Screenshot of Tax Avoider with enemies, explosions, and no taxes to avoid" height="179" width="319" /></a>
  <p>Tax Avoider is a game that has nothing to do with taxes and everything to do with avoiding. This was my first programming project, which I started all the way back in 2008 (!) and didn't give up until 2013, by which time I was too old to be programming stupid Flash games. And also Flash games were too old to be played by people. The game sucks I can make a better one during a Global Game Jam. :(</p>
