  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>This is a listing of some of my software projects. Things which are not on my list: my (nonexistent) hardware projects, my music projects, my (nonexistent) embroidery, my contact lenses, my (nonexistent) sense of self-worth.</p>

  <h3>Tsukiyo</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/tsukiyo/releases">https://github.com/eyqs/tsukiyo/releases</a></p>
  <a href="imgs/tsukiyo.png"><img src="imgs/tsukiyo.png" height="264" width="240" /></a>
  <p>Tsukiyo is a program that displays and rotates various polytopes in 4D. I spent about four months developing it as the focus of my International Baccalaureate Extended Essay and Math Internal Assessment, and then two more years on and off until I released v1.0.0 in February 2016. You can enter in a Schl√§fli symbol or Wythoff symbol, set the viewing axes and rotation axes, and rotate your polytope to your heart's content. Although it seems simple, this is my proudest project, since I personally developed all its (very simple) algorithms from scratch, without any external references!</p>

  <h3>kbr</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/kbr/releases">https://github.com/eyqs/kbr/releases</a></p>
  <a href="imgs/kbr.png"><img src="imgs/kbr.png" height="164" width="234" /></a>
  <p>kbr is a simple typing tutor that teaches touch typing. I often want to use my laptop with one hand while eating an apple/sandwich/snail/ice cream cone with the other hand, but my hand gets tired after jumping across the whole keyboard for an hour (I eat very slowly). The way I taught myself the Dvorak layout was by generating all the words that only contained the letters I knew how to type, retyping them, and gradually adding in new keys. I thought I might as well turn it into an actual program, and here it is. I typed this entire page with one hand using the dvorak-l layout.</p>

  <h3>grd</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/grd/releases">https://github.com/eyqs/grd/releases</a></p>
  <a href="imgs/grd.png"><img src="imgs/grd.png" height="135" width="465" /></a>
  <p>grd is a simple tool to help me grade C programming labs. I was a marking TA for UBC's APSC 160 in 2015WT2 and got frustrated at having to manually compile every single lab and manually quit to move through them all, so I made grd to automatically compile every single lab and automatically move through them all. Ultimately, I spent more time making grd than I saved, and I won't use it ever again, so...</p>

  <h3>Tax Avoider</h3>
  <p>GitHub link: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/tax/">https://github.com/eyqs/tax/</a></p>
  <a href="imgs/tax.png"><img src="imgs/tax.png" height="179" width="319" /></a>
  <p>Tax Avoider is a game that has nothing to do with taxes and everything to do with avoiding. This was my first programming project, which I started all the way back in 2008 (!) and didn't give up until 2013, by which time I was too old to be programming stupid Flash games. And also Flash games were too old to be played by people. The game sucks I can make a better one during a Global Game Jam. :(</p>
