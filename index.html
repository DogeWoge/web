    <p>There's one situation I hadn't considered, which is that the Undergraduate Appeals Committee completely ignores my request. Now I'm in a lose-lose-lose situation!</p>
    <p>There's actually a very well-thought-out <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/rules-about-cpsc-appeals-undergraduate-students">process for appeal</a> in the CS department. Unfortunately, the conditions for bypassing a prerequisite without taking an equivalent course are (a) a 90% average and (b) "some justification", which cannot include work experience, online courses, or independent learning. If my average were 90% I'd sure be stumped at what other justification I could possibly give.</p>

    <p>I may have accidentally signed up to write a challenge exam for CPSC 221. On the one hand, I'm scared that they'll reject my request, leaving me unable to take any other CPSC course because the prereqs for non-CPEN engineering students are so dumb. On the other hand, I'm positively frightened that they'll accept my request, leaving me unable to stop cramming for thex next 168 hours straight. So it's a lose-lose situation either way...</p>

    <p>After a year of not doing anything music-related, I forgot why I chose <a href="http://www.rosegardenmusic.com">Rosegarden</a> to replace Finale, which doesn't run on Linux. Its distinguishing characteristic seems to be its MIDI sequencer, but I'm not a MIDI sequencer. Then I discovered that, since Rosegarden uses <a href="http://lilypond.org">LilyPond</a> to print its music anyway, I might as well work with that directly.</p>
    <p>It's the first day and it's amazing. The syntax feels so clean and pure, there's no danger of accidentally moving something that screws up the layout a hundred bars later, and I immediately took advantage of wrapping a 8-bar melody in a variable and simply referring to that variable instead of copying all eight bars over and over again! There's no way I'll ever go back to Rosegarden or even Finale, whose WYSIWYG editors often give me what I'd rather not get, and all the time wasted dragging and misclicking and reformatting might really be slower than directly typing in the notes. All you need is LilyPond, and a modern text editor, and a PDF reader, and a MIDI synthesizer, and maybe throw it into version control to boot.</p>

    <p>I took the challenge exam for CPSC 110 yesterday and didn't do so well. More specifically I almost puked and the invigilator had to leave the room to get me water from the special Water Club cooler, membership at $35/year. I think my coughing really got to the guy across me cause I couldn't ever see the clock without meeting his deadly glare of pure hatred after the almost-puking thing. At least now I've really got nothing left to do, and I'll never follow those recipes ever again! They said that we would apply what we learned in CPSC 110 to all sorts of problems in life, but nobody's given me a data-driven template about handling exam stress, so I'm stuck.</p>
    <p>I did make a <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/dot/blob/master/misc/install.txt">template for installing Arch Linux</a>, by which I mean I commented my own bash history after setting up my whole laptop, so theoretically all I have to do for a fresh install is copy all the commands in that file. Realistically I'll end up reading the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide">Beginners' Guide</a> anyway because I don't trust myself and I never remember this stuff anyway.</p>

    <p>Today was the APSC 160 final exam, which I had the pleasure of invigilating. Walking around in boredom for 150 minutes was definitely not a pleasure, but it was an experience. Now I'm glad they never asked me to invigilate any of the midterms.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main">UBC Course Schedule</a> also added the 2016 Winter courses today. That's a bit unfortunate I released <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/req/releases/tag/v1.1">req v1.1</a> yesterday, which made it automagically output a list of all terms each course in UBC is offered, and now I'll have to update that list right after releasing it...</p>

    <p>So I'll probably spend my summer learning actual development technologies, taking summer courses, and hopefully getting a decent teaching assistantship. Instead of worrying about jobs I can't get, here's my <a href="{{ "/blogs/1603-teach-aide/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">March web log</a> about the job I already have.</p>

    <p>It's interesting how everybody seems to go to the UBC libraries for the library atmosphere, not the library books. Well, for the first time in literally half a decade, I went to the library today for non-school-related purposes, and got K&amp;R's <em>The C Programming Language</em>, a two-volume <em>Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation</em>, and <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>. Now you know what I'll be doing for the next month...</p>

Temporary <a href="{{ "/blogs/1602-dwarf-fort/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">blog-post for February</a> is up, half-written, and without images, because I'm still planning out what my web-site git-repository structure should be.

    <p>It took me 20 minutes to realize that I forgot to divide (a+b) by 2 when calculating an average, after which my solution passed all the tests, half an hour after contest close. Hopefully, I'll be less stupid in next year's Hacker Cup...</p>

Last term, there were six markers handling 22 lab sections, but there's only four markers this term. On the bright side, most of our marking will be during the first eight weeks.</p>

    <p>In preparation for the potential CPSC 221 challenge exam, I've neglected my JavaScript hacking completely. I added a new section to this site with <a href="{{ "/tools/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">JavaScript web tools</a> but currently it contains just one script which lets you plop down small rectangles on a larger rectangle. I tried to make some sense out of Node.js today but it just seems to be JavaScript outside a browser. "That sounds really cool!" I didn't think, and tried to make <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/nrd/releases/">a Reddit bot called nerd</a> before realizing that I never read Reddit, I have no idea what nerd's supposed to do, the <a href="https://github.com/trevorsenior/snoocore/">Node.js library I used</a> is unmaintained, everybody uses the <a href="https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/">Python library</a> instead, and why the heck would anybody willfully choose to code anything in JavaScript? Why?</p>

    <p>I made a carp game but somehow still a game. I'm particularly proud that I've made every single object in my roguelike exactly the same type, so that theoretically, your enemies can pick you up and put you into their inventory. You can play <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/ftn/releases/tag/v0.1/">FTN v0.1</a> and admire my charmingly clever AI.</p>
    <p>I'll continue to work on that for the next big while, but I promised I'd do these hackathons and so I've made <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/web/releases/">a JavaScript web app</a> that does, uh, something. I mean, it will do something soon. I spent most of today reading books about HTML5 until I realized that you can't do anything with HTML5, and then I spent the rest of today feeling dumb.</p>

    <p>Sokoban was a bad idea. Unlike sudoku or sokoban, there's no obvious beginner strategy (fill all cells that have only one valid choice; mine or flag all neighbouring cells if the numbers match) or even a guaranteed strategy (brute-force search through all valid boards; flag all the mines and mine everything else) since the search space is so big. All I could do was implement the game itself.</p>
    <p>In other words, sol can't solve it. I'm quite disappointed in myself. After an entire month exploring Lisp &amp; friends, I didn't apply anything new except for useless GUI manipulations and superficial syntax differences. I didn't use any macros, any file I/O features, or any object-oriented aspects of (especially Common) Lisp. I still think Emacs is ridiculously awkward and too memory-intensive.</p>
    <p>But I didn't completely waste my May. I've spent quite a while really trying to grok C pointers and I think I'm good enough to start working on <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/ftn/releases">FTN</a>, a Nethack clone right down to the language I'll code it in&mdash;not C++, not C#, not D, but good ol'-fashioned C.</p>

    <p>After successfully creating a dumb minesweeper solver in MIT Scheme without using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-user/Edwin.html">Edwin</a>, graphics (like in Racket), or the built-in debugger, I caved in and installed Emacs for its integration with <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> and thus basically every Common Lisp compiler there is. I'm gonna spend at least half a week getting used to all these stupid chords before I write a single line of Sokoban-specific code!</p>

    <p>The hackathon for this week: <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/sol/releases/">sol</a>, a sudoku solver copied straight out of CPSC 110. I ported it to legit Racket (basically, I typed "#lang racket" at the top), made it render pictures of the sudoku board, and tried to make it use "human strategies" instead of backtracking search. The human strategies couldn't solve the easy puzzle and I spent half an hour trying to find a puzzle it could solve. Fun!</p>

I mean, they'll always be under construction, but not "under construction" under construction. Much thanks goes to my <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/cvx/releases/">ridiculously silly LaTeX-to-HTML translater</a>, which is honestly just a find-and-replace script written in Haskell.</p>
    <p>But with that, I've the last unconstructed piece of my site, <a href="{{ "/resume/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">my resume</a>, on as both a LaTeX PDF and a hideous HTML horror. You know what that means―it's time to find a job.</p>

    <p>First, I just copied my navbar and footer manually, to every single page. Then I got tired of changing them, so I used Apache's Server Side Includes. But GitHub Pages didn't support them, so I scripted a terrible abomination that literally copied the navbar code into every single file at build time. Recently, I realized what horror I had made, and used jQuery .load() instead. Finally, I remembered that GitHub Pages had native support for <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which I had previously written off as "too complicated".</p>
    <p>Today, I'm glad to say that I've deleted my disgusting script because Jekyll is exactly what I wanted my script to be! The site still looks exactly the same, but don't be fooled―it's all served by Jekyll now.</p>
