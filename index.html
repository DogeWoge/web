        <p>Welcome to my home page! I'm a first year Engineering student at the University of British Columbia.</p>
        <p>Everything is under construction right now, but you can find me at one of the links below:</p>

                <p>Check out my blog―it's not under construction any more, it's <a href="blog.html">my first post</a>! Well, actually, it's still under construction, but...</p>

                <p>I woke up past 10:00, today being a Sunday, despite mentally alarming (I don't believe in external alarm clocks) myself to wake up at 8:00, since I hadn't submitted my second solution yet!</p>
                <p>It took me 20 minutes to realize that I forgot to divide (a+b) by 2 when calculating an average, after which my solution passed all the tests, half an hour after contest close. Hopefully, I'll be less stupid in next year's Hacker Cup...</p>

                <p>Everybody that knows me knows that I don't have a Facebook account... until today, the day of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/">Facebook Hacker Cup</a> qualification round!</p>
                <p>If you want to add me as a friend on Facebook, you'll have to be a friend of one of my friends. But I promise I'll never friend anyone, hehe.</p>

                <p>Back to school! I got my TA assignment today for APSC160: no labs, no tutorials, no office hours... just marking. Last term, there were six markers handling 22 lab sections, but there's only four markers this term. On the bright side, most of our marking will be during the first eight weeks.</p>

                <p>After visiting my optometrist yesterday and discovering my eyesight had deteriorated by another 0.25 dioptres in spite of orthokeratology, I finally declared that I would take a break every 30 minutes from staring at computer screens. Hence comes forth <a href="https://github.com/eyqs/2do">2do</a>, in which I unleash the power of D-Bus notifications to notificationize me.</p>

                <p>I've finally run out of things to automate. Starting with a script to copy the navbar and footer across all my webpages I wrote exactly two weeks ago, I've written a script to tally things for when I can't be bothered to find pen and paper, a script to check all my repos' git status for uncommitted changes, a script to automatically compile, execute, and move between APSC160 labs I need to mark, and even a script to calculate e.g. direction cosines or cross product for Mastering[SubjectName] and WebWork!</p>
                <p>All those scripts are in Python, and there would've been one more to automatically compile my C algorithm implementations into shared objects, if I hadn't realized that's basically a makefile...</p>

                <p>I finally bought my own domain, at <a href="http://eyqs.ca/">http://eyqs.ca/</a>, although all it does is point to the GitHub Pages site at <a href="http://eyqs.github.io/">http://eyqs.github.io/</a>.</p>
                <p>I bought the domain for a year from <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> and transferred the DNS to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, all for under $12.00 USD (but the exchange rate...)</p>
