description: A collection of situations that may encourage deceit in those who haven't read this 2016 June blog post.

I was going to post something here but then it was too late again, so I'll post a temporary thing here until I shed enough of my laziness to find some situations that may encourage deceit in those who haven't read this 2016 June blog post.

Basically, my family's been renovating a dilapidated 1920s era house (or so the renovationist claimed before suddenly vanishing) because we're too poor to hire actual renovationists to renovate it. For whatever reason unknown to me and mankind, this entailed ripping out all the 1920s era drywall, by my parents' hands. Now we've been running around town for the past week trying to find a place where we can actually dump drywall, seeing that <a href="http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/how-to-dispose-of-drywall.aspx">the city landfill</a> only accepts "new, unfinished cuts of drywall without tape, mud, paint, or texture coating from new construction and never installed", a.k.a., nothing. Eventually, my parents decided to dig a huge trench in the back of our house and illegally bury all the drywall there just because the official process was so frustrating, but not before sending a sample in for analysis just in case our 1920s era drywall wasn't actually carcinogenic and they both didn't receive lethal doses of permanent lung cancer.

Turns out there was no asbestos in it after all and everyone lived happily ever after. But there are plenty more situations that may encourage deceit in frustrated folks, and I'll get to those when I get less lazy...
