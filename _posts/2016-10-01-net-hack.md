<a href="http://www.nethack.org/">Nethack</a>. Some say it's the most inscrutable video game ever. A few say it's the deepest. Most saw the ncurses ASCII interface and never bothered to try playing a game that looks like it predates Windows. A few downloaded it and quit in frustration from the steep learning curve and unintuitive user interface.

I tried it. I downloaded it. I finished the standard strategy tutorial on the indispensable <a href="http://nethackwiki.com/">Nethack Wiki</a>. I played for a while, went all the way down to Mine's End and all the way up to Sokoban. Then I quit, not from frustration, but from boredom. All I did was steal stuff from shops with my pet all day long. Blah blah blah.

&lt;The rest of this introductory paragraph is a direct copy of the introductory paragraph of my Dwarf Fortress post. But it's the middle of midterms so I don't have time to actually write it, or even make it to the Quest! So, stay tuned for more...&gt;
