title: The Iron Pin, the Iron Ring, and the Iron Knee
description: I have no idea what I'm going to write here. It's also definitely not 2016 November.

I went to UBC's Iron Pin ceremony last year as a silly little first year with no friends accompanying, and all I remembered was a little old lady standing up at the stage whose opening remarks were something to the tune of "lol i know we girls all hate physics" or whatever. I'm trying really hard to remember what she said but I just can't. It was something so blatantly sexist that I thought the applause would at least be a bit more subdued but nope, and that cognitive dissonance was the only thing I got out of the whole ceremony. Besides the Iron Pin itself. And a little card with the 12 Tenets of Engineering or 7 Principles of Ethical Design or whatever, which I still have and can actually read the name of but it's too late and I'm too lazy to bother.

Anyway now that I've tried to think of what she said, I realize that I really can't think of anything both offensive enough to make me remember the feeling of dissonance even until now, but simultaneously mundane and quaint enough to merit undivided applause. And that is why I will update this post when I finally remember. It might have had to do with math or computers, and it might have had to do with struggling or disliking, and it might have been the girls of the past or the girls still in secondary, and I don't even know why I'm writing this post, stop reading it...
