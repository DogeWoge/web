University and high school are supposed to be totally different: <del>in university, you explore the universe from a city, while in high school, you get high, and then you get schooled.</del> Also, the general consensus seems to be that the best year of your life is either your senior year in high school or your freshman year in university. So I thought I'd have a lot to write about in this post.

Turns out that, for me, university and high school were basically the same, and both were totally boring. Instead of writing about my daily drudgeries directly, I've decided to compile them into a list of dubiously helpful Tips and Tricks&trade; for first-year students. Follow them at your peril&hellip;

#### 1. Take 8:00 a.m. Classes

Perhaps the biggest difference between university and high school is that some people get to sleep in until 5 minutes before lecture, and others have to bus from an hour away. For commuters, it should make sense to take the latest classes possible, but I had the good luck to have both 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. classes in both terms. The transition's actually not as hard as you might think, and there may actually be some benefits.

- You might find that you're actually a morning person. I'm not, but in high school, I just couldn't concentrate on homework until after 10 p.m. After pushing back my sleeping schedule, I now start my homework in time to finish before midnight! (When it's due&hellip;)
- You might have a choice now, but as you go into third or fourth year and your required courses have only one section each, eventually you'll have to take 8:00 a.m. classes.
- Face it, you sleep in until 11 during summers. If you have to readjust your sleep schedule to wake up at 9 anyway, you can push it back an extra hour or two more.
- People who show up to morning lectures tend to be tryhards, which is great if you need homework help.
- People who don't show up to morning lectures tend to do badly, so if the prof scales your section up, you might get a better grade. Alternatively, if the prof scales your section down, maybe your section was so much easier than the others that you got a much higher grade than you would've gotten in another section and the postscaling doesn't pull it down enough to actually I have no idea.

Honestly, I just made these benefits up. The main reason you should take 8:00 a.m. classes only applies to commuters: buses go faster in the early morning, and you can always get a seat.

#### 2. Explore the Campus

No matter where you go for university, you should explore its campus. That goes tentuple for UBC, because ten is the number of major projects (that each cost at least $20 million) currently under construction. UBC loves construction more than it loves education, and you ought to appreciate where all your tuition money is getting sucked into.

During your first week at UBC, you'll probably want to get a campus map from a library or something; I kept mine for an entire month and I still got lost. But eventually, you can memorize the entire map and impress your friends with your detailed knowledge of campus geography ("Oh, you want to get from the Landscape Architecture Annex to the School of Social Work? Just follow me!"). Or you can just use your phone.

#### 3. Cram a Week Before

The problem with studying too much (like me) is that you waste all that time studying instead of playing video games or binge-watching some crappy sitcom. Unless you're aiming for a career as a scientist, research engineer, research artist, or research forestry worker person, there's really no point in learning so much information, since it's your soft skills that really matter. Since you'd rather fill your long-term memory with sports data or sappy drama plots than integral tables or organic reactions, cramming right before the exam should be the way to go.

But you can't always cram right before it. In high school and for first-year standard timetable schedules, midterms and final exams are usually spaced out quite nicely. But if you're not on a standard timetable, or you're an upper-year student, you'll likely come across some frustrating exam times. Maybe you'll have two exams in one day, or maybe five exams in one week. Furthermore, information probably needs at least a day to settle. You'll often come up with new questions, suddenly develop a deeper understanding of a previously obscure equation, and usually realize that your cramming is woefully inadequate. But if you cram a week in advance, you still have time to cram some more.

A minor caveat: if you actually have to learn something, maybe for a future career or required course, then, uh, you should probably actually learn it and not cram at all.

#### 4. Find Study Spots

This isn't really about finding study spots, but I only realized that after I couldn't think of any actual study spots (I study at home). Instead of finding an individual study spot, try making a study group and see how it goes. University study groups are completely (not really) different from high school study groups, so even though they might have been useless in high school, they might be great in university. Actually, I have no idea, I never tried, but now I regret it. So try!

What this is really about is telling you not to study on the bus. Don't study on the bus! Alright, you can try it, but if you don't like it, don't do it. I've tried but my eyes feel violated every single time. You can't visually focus on anything because of all the vibrations, especially on UBC's shamefully bumpy roads, and you can't mentally focus on anything because the bus screeches to a halt about once a minute. The fruits of your labour are all stolen away by the awesome distraction machine that is a bus. Maybe it's feasible if you make little cue cards or something to memorize and only look at them once in a while. Otherwise, it's better to take a power nap and save up energy for later than to sneak in a couple extra minutes of fruitless studying.

#### 5. Be Respectful

If you got into university, you're mentally an adult, so act like one. It really comes down to a) don't be noisy while the instructor's talking, and b) don't be smelly. As for the other senses, c) nobody's gonna touch you, d) nobody's gonna force you to taste them (???), and e) it's politically incorrect to feel disrespected due to a person's fashion sense. People are actually generally good in the smell department, since it's mostly me that brings smelly Chinese food into lecture. Don't be me.

So it really comes down to noisiness, which is a real problem. In my PHYS 170 section, the noise got so bad our instructor had to shout people down and it still took 5 minutes to restore order. 5 minutes every single time we had an iClicker discussion, which was like a dozen times per lecture. I ended up skipping half the lectures due to the noise and PHYS 170 became my worst mark that term. Don't talk, unwrap your wraps and wrappers before you come in, turn your phones to silent, and pay attention to the lecture!

On a marginally related note, call your instructors whatever they introduce themselves as. If it's their first name, call them by their first name. Before you call anyone Prof., make sure they're actually a professor first. UBC loves hiring sessional instructors so they can divert funds from teaching into building, so call these lecturers Dr. instead. Administrative people are Ms. or Mr., but usually go by their first name for some reason.

#### 6. Get Involved

Don't be lonely&mdash;get involved! Go to Imagine Day, go to the events in Imagine Week or whatever it's called, go to Clubs Day, join clubs, join sports teams, explore volunteer opportunities, go to the Day of the Longboat, go to the events in that week where every faculty does something (whatever it's called), go to Storm the Wall, etc. etc. I didn't go to anything but I joined engineering student teams and they were really fun and I felt really involved. But then I quit and I became unfun and uninvolved and I regretted quitting and also not going to any of the events and blah blah blah.

#### 7. Ask Around

Before "seek and you shall find", Matthew said "ask, and it shall be given to you." UBC is much the same as ancient Israel, so if you want something, ask Google to find out whom to ask, and then ask for it. Maybe I'm just an annoying twit, but I did this a lot and always got what I asked for.

- They said that a score of 68% or higher in PHYS 102/108/153 was required to take MATH 217. I emailed them and said that my IB Physics HL is basically equivalent, and they let me into the course.
- They put me in a super late APSC 100 section, then said that switching sections in APSC 100 was permitted for extenuating circumstances only. I emailed them and said the section conflicted with ACM practices, and they switched it to a much better time. (Although ACM was meant to be an excuse, I attended most of the practices anyway&hellip;)
- They said that only third-years and above can take student directed seminars like CPSC 490. I showed up anyway.
- My MUSC 106 section had a conflict, so I couldn't register. I showed up in a class of 10 people and participated anyway.
- My MATH 152 prof was really bad. I switched to another section and the non-professor instructor turned out to be the best university lecturer I've had.
- I had a conflict between a CPSC 490 seminar and a PHYS 158 tutorial. They switched my tutorial to another time, even though I'm not registered in CPSC 490.
- I had a conflict between Putnam practices and a PHYS 170 tutorial. They switched my tutorial to another time, even though turns out there are no term two Putnam practices. I actually ended up with a worse schedule overall&hellip;
- I went to my APSC 160 prof and asked to become a TA in term two. I became a TA in term two.
- They said that CPSC 221 was required to take CPSC 320, and that CPSC 210 and CPSC 121 were required to take CPSC 221. I haven't taken any of these courses, but I appealed and successfully completed CPSC 320.
- I went to my URO mentor's supervisor and asked to volunteer for his lab. I begin next week.

So find out what you want, find out whom to ask, find legitimate reasons for asking, and then ask. If you're polite, respectful, and have good supporting reasons, you'll likely get what you asked for. If you're rude or your reasons suck, well, you asked for it!

#### 8. Save Money

I had $2200 in student loans last year earmarked for "Books / Supplies". For first year engineering, you can get away with spending less than $200.

As much as possible, don't buy textbooks. For some courses, they're required&mdash;maybe the entire course is structured around the textbook, or you have to hand pages in from a lab manual, or the entire textbook is just a copy of the professor's Microsoft Word lecture notes that you can't get anywhere else. If they're not, don't buy them. Since first years around the world basically take the same first-year courses, you can find the same information anywhere on the web, for free. For calculus, [PatrickJMT](http://patrickjmt.com) and [Paul's Notes](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu) are far more accessible and engaging than any dead-tree textbook. For physics, [HyperPhysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html) has nice overviews and [Michel van Biezen](https://www.youtube.com/user/ilectureonline) has amazing videos on quite high-level topics. I've also summarized every chapter from the relevant textbooks in my [PHYS 158 and PHYS 170 notes](/documents/).

"But wait," you exclaim, "If we don't buy textbooks, then what incentive will textbook publishers have to keep publishing them?" None, they'll have no incentive and everyone will be happy, because it's 2016 and information online is better than any first-year textbook. I know the UBC math department is already putting together a set of unified lecture notes to replace all first-year calculus and linear algebra textbooks. People have been teaching first-year courses for dozens of years; we don't need new textbooks or new editions of old textbooks. Look at James Stewart, the Canadian author of perhaps the most popular calculus textbook in the world. He built the [Integral House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_House), which has its very own Wikipedia page, for $32 million! He doesn't need even more money for knowledge anyone can easily find online, especially after, um, his death a year ago. Go ahead, support authors and publishers by buying all the less popular third- and fourth-year textbooks you need. Chances are you can't find the information online anyway.

If you have to buy textbooks, want to save money, and don't want to support the authors, buy them used. Browse [Amazon Books](www.amazon.com/books-used-books-textbooks/b/ref=topnav_storetab_b?node=283155), [AbeBooks](http://www.abebooks.com), and all those UBC Buy/Sell groups on Facebook for the best deals before buying anything. But again, just don't bother with first-year textbooks at all, and buy obscure upper-year textbooks directly to support the authors, who probably don't have their own $32 million house.

My final tip is a risky one. Usually, UBC first-year physics courses require iClicker participation, paper homework submissions, and [Mastering Physics](https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/northamerica/) (or Mastering Engineering), a clunky interactive online exercise system. You get exactly the same learning experience by just doing the actual problems in the textbook, which Mastering Something copies directly. But to access Mastering Something, you have to buy an online access code which costs $96 this year, or $200 when bundled with the textbook.

You don't need to buy it. None of it is truly required. Homework never counts for more than 10% in physics courses; otherwise, nobody would fail and nobody would get A+. I found this out the dumb way, by buying the stupid access code, submitting half of my homework 10 minutes late, quitting in frustration, and then finding out that if you do better in your final than in the rest of the course, your final grade (the grade in your final exam) becomes your final grade (for the entire course). This may not be the case next year, so if you choose not to buy the access codes, you're gambling with your grades. But would you pay $100 to bump up your grade by 5%?

#### 9. Have Fun!

Ultimately, everything's gonna be alright. Anything that you think might matter this year definitely won't matter a decade later, but the memories you make will last forever. This is your first year of university and you really can make it the best year of your life, if you try! I didn't try, didn't get involved, and didn't have fun, so it probably wasn't the best year of <em>my</em> life, although my life has been pretty uneventful so far, so maybe it was, but that doesn't mean much. You get the point; just put yourself out there and you can do anything, otherwise you'll end up regretful and typing incoherent blobs like this.
