title: The Un-Co-Operative System of Co-Operative Education
description: A reflection of my experience co-op hunting for the first time, with mixed results until 2016 December.

I don't actually think Co-op is uncooperative, but I do think it's funny writing the word "Un-Co-Operative" with so many hyphens and capitals. Anyway, I have a legit reason for being unable to publish on time this month: I don't actually have a job yet. So. I will update this post with my reflection on the job hunting experience once I have a job. If I don't have a job, then I'll change this post to be about baby octopodes.

Here are some temporary tips and tricks to help you secure your first co-op term before December, unlike me:

1. Apply early.
2. Apply a lot.
3. Apply early to a lot.
4. Apply to a lot of jobs, early.
5. Don't apply late or apply to few jobs.
6. Send thank you letters to your employers, or else they won't contact you back, even if they promised to contact you back within two days of the interview regardless of whether you passed or failed, and they give offers to your two other classmates who interviewed with them on the same day and heard back within two days of the interview that they passed the first round.
7. I-It's not like I wanted to work t-there anyway, baka.
