      <p>I watched The Wandering Earth and wanted to review it, but I figured it’d be better if I had read its source novella too, but it’s in Chinese, so I haven’t even finished reading it, because I didn’t do a single thing this reading break, so I’ll write this post later. Actually, everything I do is a single thing unless I get a girlfriend :0</p>

        <time datetime="2019-01-01T00:00:00-08:00" pubdate="pubdate">2019 January</time>

      <p>I know when I’ll be sick, two days before any physical symptoms appear. That’s why I cancelled my free trip, all-expenses-paid hotel, flight included (without cost, without charge), and complimentary unlimited (free) food from the <a href="https://www.communitech.ca/how-we-help/talent/code-to-win/">Communitech Code to Win</a> competition two years in a row. Well, last year, it was because I contracted meningitis and ended up in the emergency room for a midnight lumbar puncture, only to discover it was viral meningitis, which requires an intense battery of pharmaceutical remedies including dihydrogen monoxide, hydroxic acid, and extreme sleep. But this year, just two weeks ago, I withdrew from the competition the day before my flight despite having no physical symptoms whatsoever—no cough, no fever, no sore throat, no extreme death, no runny nose, nothing.</p>

<p>Happy new year. You’ll get lost in this post. I’m not sure what it’s really about, so I hereby declare: this is a post about my new year’s resolutions. Keep that in mind.</p>

        <time datetime="2018-11-01T00:00:00-07:00" pubdate="pubdate">2018 November</time>
      </header>
      <p>Technically, this is supposed to be a report on all the UBC contemporary music concerts that have happened this term, but it just so happens that all of these concerts happened in November, so here’s the 2018 November concert report. Me being lazy, I didn’t actually write up the post until now, so my memories of the earlier concerts are pretty hazy. Taking notes helps a little, but I can’t see what I’m writing in the dark, so it usually ends up being gibberish.</p>

      <p>I’m currently reading Kyle Simpson’s <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/">You Don’t Know JS</a> (YDKJS), the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E80000">eighth-most starred project on GitHub</a>, often considered the best JavaScript series ever written, and it is the best JavaScript series I’ve ever read. If you’re going to really work with JavaScript, or Node.js, or TypeScript, please just read <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch3.md">this summary</a> to see everything you’re missing out on.</p>

<p>But although the explanations are extremely comprehensive (yet mysteriously brief), there’s no end-of-chapter problems for me to solidify my understanding. If you’ve read that summary, you’ll think that Kyle’s favourite word is “perhaps” and his favourite hobby is debunking common misconceptions, demystifying widespread myths, tackling persistent mistruths, and overthrowing conventional wisdom about JavaScript. His eternal enemies are all the commoners who pause at a WTF moment, shrug their shoulders, and say resignedly, “Just JavaScript, eh?”</p>

<p>So what better way to test my newfound knowledge than by addressing all these WTFs?</p>

      <p>In grade four of elementary school, my parents put me in a special education program for special children, not because I was special, but because my brother finally started doing homework at home (instead of schoolwork at school) after going through the program, so they wanted me to suffer as well. As special children, we each had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program">Individual Education Plan</a> with individual education goals that we had to revise and track our progress through every term.</p>

<p>From the first term in grade four to the last term in grade seven, I always had exactly the same primary goal, and for every term from the first of grade four to the last of grade seven, I made exactly zero progress on this goal. It’s haunted me how futile all my strategies have been despite <del>my best</del> some efforts, throughout all of junior high, throughout all of IB, throughout first year and second year and third year and so finally, starting today, I give up on trying to stop procrastinating.</p>

<p>The next goal in my Individual Education Plan is to stop missing the bus.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">A Review of All UBC's Computer Engineering/Science Courses That Eugene Actually Took</h1>

      <p>Engineering undergrads at the University of British Columbia don’t get many electives. They only get to choose three of their <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,195,272,30">complementary studies courses</a>, one for impact of technology on society and two for humanities and social sciences. Different engineering programs differ on their number of technical electives, from ten in computer engineering to only two in chemical/biological engineering and mechatronics.</p>

<p>As an engineering physics student, I get five technical electives, but I’ve already used them all up. As I’ll never get to actually take any more computer engineering/science courses for the last three years of my degree, now’s the time to review all such courses I’ve actually taken. Also, I finally get to brag about my grades.</p>
